### 🟥 CVE-2025-20333

**Type:** RCE (Remote Code Execution)  
**Affected Devices:** Cisco ASA / FTD  

**Description:**  
This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute commands remotely through 
the HTTP/HTTPS management interface.
The critical risk lies in the fact that the commands are executed with **root-level privileges**,
which represents the highest level of access on the system and results in full device compromise.

**Potential Impact:**
- Full control over the firewall  
- Modification of security configurations  
- Disabling protection or monitoring services  
- Using the device as a pivot point for internal network attacks  

**Security Severity:**  
Very high, as ASA and FTD devices are commonly deployed at the network perimeter.

### 🟧 CVE-2025-20362

**Type:** Authentication Bypass  
**Affected Devices:** Cisco ASA / FTD  

**Description:**  
This vulnerability allows an attacker to access the web-based management interface
**without proper authentication**, due to a flaw in the user validation process.

**Potential Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to the management interface  
- Exposure of sensitive configuration data  
- Possible modification of security settings  
- Enables more advanced attacks (such as RCE)  

**Security Severity:**  
High, as it bypasses the first line of defense: authentication.

### 🟥 CVE-2025-20352

**Type:** RCE / Denial of Service (DoS)  
**Affected Devices:** Cisco IOS / IOS XE  

**Description:**  
This vulnerability may allow an attacker to either:
- Execute code remotely, or  
- Cause a **Denial of Service (DoS)** by crashing the device  

The issue is caused by improper handling of specific data or protocol
processing within the operating system.

**Potential Impact:**
- Complete network outage  
- Loss of connectivity between sites  
- Direct impact on business continuity  

**Security Severity:**  
Critical, especially since IOS and IOS XE are used on core routing infrastructure.
