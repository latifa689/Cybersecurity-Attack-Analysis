# Attack Overview

## Introduction

This repository provides a structured analysis of cybersecurity threats
in today’s interconnected digital environment. As organizations and individuals
increasingly rely on digital systems and advanced technologies, the exposure to
malicious cyber activities continues to grow.

Cyber threats pose significant risks, including data breaches, service
disruptions, financial losses, and potential impacts on national and
organizational security. Understanding the severity of these threats is
essential for developing effective prevention and mitigation strategies.

This project establishes a foundational framework for analyzing cyber attacks
and exploring appropriate defensive measures based on cybersecurity best
practices.

## Case Study: Cisco Edge Devices Exploitation (2025)

In 2025, a large-scale exploitation campaign targeted Cisco edge devices,
Including ASA, Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), IOS, and IOS XE platforms.
Attackers exploited multiple critical vulnerabilities that enabled Remote code execution, 
authentication bypass, unauthorized configuration Manipulation, and long-term persistence
within enterprise networks.

These vulnerabilities allowed threat actors to gain deep access to Network infrastructure,
posing significant risks to confidentiality, Integrity, and availability of critical systems.

This case study provides a comprehensive academic analysis of the Incident, Examining vulnerability
characteristics, attack vectors, operational impact, And recommended mitigation strategies. The objective
is to outline lessons Learned and highlight best practices for securing modern network Infrastructures
