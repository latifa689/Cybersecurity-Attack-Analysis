This repository provides a structured analysis of cybersecurity threats
in today’s interconnected digital environment. As organizations and individuals
increasingly rely on digital systems and advanced technologies, the exposure to
malicious cyber activities continues to grow.

Cyber threats pose significant risks, including data breaches, service
disruptions, financial losses, and potential impacts on national and
organizational security. Understanding the severity of these threats is
essential for developing effective prevention and mitigation strategies.

This project establishes a foundational framework for analyzing cyber attacks
and exploring appropriate defensive measures based on cybersecurity best
practices.
