## Attack Methodology

The attack was carried out in multiple stages:

1.	Reconnaissance:
   The attacker scanned the target network to identify open ports,
   Services, and potential vulnerabilities.

2.	Initial Access:
   Exploitation of weak authentication or unpatched vulnerabilities
   To gain unauthorized access.

3.	Privilege Escalation:
   The attacker attempted to gain higher-level access to control
   Critical systems.

4.	Lateral Movement:
   Movement across the internal network to access additional resources.

5.	Persistence:
   Techniques used to maintain access and avoid detection.
